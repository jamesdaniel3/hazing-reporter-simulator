# Hazing Reporter Application Simulator

This application began as a part of a project for my Advanced Software Development course 
at the University of Virginia. I found that working on the website was very good for my learning, so I recreated 
the GitHub repository on my own and put it here so that I can continue working on it.

This project is a website that is meant to simulate a hazing reporting system, specifically for UVA. Currently, the project
is hosted on Heroku, and uses a combination of PostgreSQL and Amazon S3 for storage.

The original GitHub can be found here, so long as it is up: https://github.com/uva-cs3240-s24/project-b-24

The live website can be found here:  https://hazing-reporter-simulator-4777047cf362.herokuapp.com/
