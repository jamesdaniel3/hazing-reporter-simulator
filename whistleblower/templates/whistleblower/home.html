        <div class="title">Hazing</div>
        <p>Hazing is a crime in the Commonwealth of Virginia and is prohibited in accordance with University of Virginia's
        policy and the Universityâ€™s Standards of Conduct. The University does not condone hazing in any form. Hazing is defined
        as any action or situation created by one or more members, advisors, or coaches of a student organization
        (including athletic teams) toward other organization members or prospective members that intentionally or
        recklessly threatens or produces mental or physical harassment, humiliation, fatigue, degradation, ridicule,
        shock, or injury. The action or situation is in connection with initiation, admission, affiliation, or ongoing
        membership in the organization, may occur with or without the consent of the participants, and may occur on
        or off University Property.</p>

        <div class="title">Reporting an Incident</div>
        <p>To report a hazing incident, simply click on the Make a Report button at top of the page, and you will be redirected
        to a form where you will be asked to fill out the necessary information. If you would like
        to report the hazing anonymously, feel free to fill out the report without using the sign in feature on the website. Otherwise,
        please use the Sign in button before making your report. Users who report anonymously will not
        receive updates on the status of their report, while those who sign in will. </p>

        <div class="title">The Process</div>
        <p>To create a report, simply click on the Make a Report button, fill out the form, and click Submit. If you do not sign in
        before making the report, the submission will be anonymous. If you sign in, a button will appear next to the Make
        a Report button called My Reports. This will take you to a page where you can see the status of your report and get
        notes about the outcome of the report. After submitting a report, an admin will review your report and provide feedback
        about any action that is taken. </p>
